        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Hold your paper vertically on the table. Fold the top right corner down to the left so the top edge of the paper meets equally with the left side of the paper. This creates a big triangle with some excess at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Use your scissors to cut off that excess paper at the bottom and recycle it.</li>
            <li>Unfold your paper. Fold the opposite corners to meet each other and upfold again. You should now have a square paper with a folded X in the middle.</li>
            <li>Turn your paper diagonally (like a diamond) and fold each corner up to meet in the center. This will create a smaller square.</li>
            <li>Flip the whole thing over and again, fold all the corners in to meet in the middle. This creates an even smaller square.</li>
            <li>Fold the whole thing in half to make it easier to bend. Unfold and fold it in half the other way.</li>
